# Step 1: Define URL to scrape and the item you would like to search
URL = ''
ITEM = input("What do you want to recycle?")

# Step 2: Grab the data with a GET request

# Step 3: Parse the HTML using Beautiful Soup

# Step 4: Filter out items that can be recycled and clean output

# Step 5: Print out the relevant searched items

# NOTE: this is nowhere near comprehensive. This is where finding more sites to scrape would be useful! 
# Because then we could get an aggregate. But that's for next time. :)
