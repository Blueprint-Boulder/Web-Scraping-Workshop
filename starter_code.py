# Part A: Define URL to scrape and the item you would like to search
URL = 'https://removeandreplace.com/2013/09/24/complete-list-can-recycle/'
ITEM = input("Item to recycle?: ")

# Part B: Grab the data with a GET request

# Part C: Parse the HTML using Beautiful Soup

# Part D: Filter out items that can be recycled and clean output

# Part E: Print out the relevant searched items

# NOTE: this is nowhere near comprehensive. This is where finding more sites to scrape would be useful! 
# Because then we could get an aggregate. But that's for next time. :)
